# DockingPortAlignmentIndicator

This is a copy of NavyFish's Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod for Kerbal Space Program.

**Please do NOT bother NavyFish with any bugs arising from using this unofficial version**

The original snapshot of the code was taken from the current (as of 2018-10-22) v6.8.2 release available on [SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info/mod/543/Docking%20Port%20Alignment%20Indicator). It was then modified to remove runtime warnings and recompiled and tested on KSP v1.5.x.

The [forum thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=40423) contains all remaining relevant information.
